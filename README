Source code for Android Game Application Cardiocritters

Project was picked up by American Heart Association, but due to low budget and personal problems,
the project was decided to be dropped as there were barely any developers to continue the project.

All that remains is the source code for some minigames, minigame templates, basic game architecture, and 
physics code that was thought to be needed for Minigames, but soon scrapped.
